# Name of the dataset used to calculate gridded drought metric (must not contain spaces) -- will be used to organize paths

# Start and end years for the drought metric
start_year: 1999

# Threshold for drought definition (if using percentiles, 0.2 corresponds to 20th percentile)

# Set boolean variable of whether to treat the right/left edges of the map as periodic

# Path to the directory where the drought clusters will be saved
# The full path where the clusters will be saved is recommended to take the following order:
#       clusters_full_path = clusters_partial_path/dataset/region/drought_metric/drought_threshold/
# This will allow for easy organization if clusters are calculated for multiple datasets,
# regions, variables, and drought thresholds.
